Modified Code: Count Combinations with Memoization
javascript
Copy code
function countCoinCombinations(coins, amount) {
const memo = new Map();

    function dp(remaining, start) {
        // Base cases
        if (remaining === 0) return 1; // One valid combination (empty set)
        if (remaining < 0) return 0;  // No valid combinations

        // Check memo
        const key = `${remaining}-${start}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);

        let count = 0;
        for (let i = start; i < coins.length; i++) {
            // Count combinations using coin i
            count += dp(remaining - coins[i], i);
        }

        // Store result in memo
        memo.set(key, count);
        return count;
    }

    return dp(amount, 0);

}

// Example usage:
const coins = [1, 2, 5];
const amount = 5;

console.log(countCoinCombinations(coins, amount)); // Output: 4
Explanation
Recursive Function:

dp(remaining, start) calculates the number of ways to make up the amount remaining using coins starting from the start index.
Base Cases:

remaining === 0: There’s exactly 1 way to make up the amount (no coins added further).
remaining < 0: No valid combination exists, so return 0.
Recursive Formula:

For each coin starting from index start, calculate the count of combinations for remaining - coins[i].
Add up the counts returned by the recursive calls.
Memoization:

Use remaining and start as the key:
javascript
Copy code
const key = `${remaining}-${start}`;
This ensures results are cached uniquely for each combination of remaining and start.
Example Walkthrough
Input:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 5

Recursive Calls:
Start at dp(5, 0):

Try coin 1: dp(4, 0)
Try coin 2: dp(3, 1)
Try coin 5: dp(0, 2) (Base case: 1)
Continue for smaller amounts:

dp(4, 0):
Try coin 1: dp(3, 0)
Try coin 2: dp(2, 1)
...
Memoized results avoid recalculating counts for repeated subproblems.

Output:
The total count of combinations is 4:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 2]
[5]
Complexity
Time Complexity:
𝑂
(
amount
×
coins.length
)
O(amount×coins.length): Each subproblem is solved once and stored in the memo.
Space Complexity:
𝑂
(

)
O(amount×coins.length): For the memoization table.
Advantage
This version avoids building full combinations, focusing only on counting them. It’s faster and uses less memory than the full backtracking approach.

function coinCombinationsWithMemo(coins, amount) {
const memo = new Map();

    function backtrack(remaining, start) {
        // Base cases
        if (remaining === 0) return [[]]; // One valid combination (empty list)
        if (remaining < 0) return [];    // No valid combination

        // Check memo
        const key = `${remaining}-${start}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);

        const combinations = [];
        for (let i = start; i < coins.length; i++) {
            // Get combinations for the reduced amount
            const subCombinations = backtrack(remaining - coins[i], i);
            for (const combo of subCombinations) {
                combinations.push([coins[i], ...combo]); // Add current coin to each combination
            }
        }

        // Store in memo
        memo.set(key, combinations);
        return combinations;
    }

    return backtrack(amount, 0);

}

// Example usage:
const coins = [1, 2, 5];
const amount = 5;

console.log(coinCombinationsWithMemo(coins, amount));
Example:
Input:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 5

Output:
javascript
Copy code
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 2],
[1, 2, 2],
[5]
]
Explanation:
Recursive Function:

The backtrack function computes all combinations for a given remaining amount and start index.
Each call reduces the remaining amount by choosing a coin.
Memoization:

The key in the memo combines the remaining amount and the start index.
This ensures that results for the same subproblem are reused, avoiding redundant calculations.
Combination Construction:

For each valid combination returned from the recursive call, add the current coin (coins[i]) to form new combinations.
Base Cases:

remaining === 0: Return a single empty combination ([[]]) as a base to build valid combinations.
remaining < 0: Return an empty list because no valid combinations exist.
Complexity:
Time Complexity:
𝑂
(
amount
×
coins.length
)
O(amount×coins.length) — Due to memoization, each subproblem is solved only once.
Space Complexity:
𝑂
(
amount
×
coins.length
)
O(amount×coins.length) — For memoization storage and recursion stack.
Advantages of Memoization:
Avoids recalculating combinations for the same remaining amount and start index.
Significantly reduces redundant recursive calls, making it efficient for larger inputs.

what is the point of the remaining amount and start index in the key of the memo

The point of using both the remaining amount and the start index in the key of the memoization is to ensure that the memo stores results uniquely for each state of the problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Why Use remaining in the Key?
   The remaining amount represents the current subproblem we're solving. For each unique value of remaining, the combinations may differ based on how the amount can be achieved using the given coins.

For example:

If remaining = 5, the combinations might be:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 2]
[5]
Each unique value of remaining needs to be tracked because the result for remaining = 5 is different from the result for remaining = 4.

2. Why Use start in the Key?
   The start index ensures that combinations are constructed without repeating or rearranging the same coins in different orders. It enforces the rule that:

Each combination includes coins in non-decreasing order.
By including start:

We limit the recursion to only consider coins from the current index onward.
This avoids duplicate combinations like [1, 2] and [2, 1].
For example:

When remaining = 5 and start = 1, only coins [2, 5] are considered for further recursion.
When remaining = 5 and start = 2, only coin [5] is considered.
Without start in the key, the same remaining amount might lead to different (but equivalent) combinations being calculated multiple times.

How the Key Works:
The key is a combination of remaining and start:

javascript
Copy code
const key = `${remaining}-${start}`;
This ensures that:

Subproblems for different amounts (remaining) are solved independently.
Subproblems for the same amount but different start indices (coin subsets) are solved independently.
Example:
Coins: [1, 2, 5]
Amount: 5
Subproblem 1: remaining = 5, start = 0 (Coins: [1, 2, 5])

Combos: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [5]
Subproblem 2: remaining = 5, start = 1 (Coins: [2, 5])

Combos: [1, 2, 2], [5] (Overlaps avoided due to starting index)
Subproblem 3: remaining = 5, start = 2 (Coins: [5])

Combos: [5]
Without start in the key, results for the same remaining but different coin subsets would overlap, leading to incorrect or redundant results.

Summary:
Including both remaining and start:

Distinguishes subproblems:
remaining ensures different amounts are solved independently.
start ensures different subsets of coins are solved independently.
Avoids duplicate combinations:
Prevents rearranged versions of the same combination.
Improves efficiency:
Ensures each unique subproblem is solved only once and stored in the memo.
