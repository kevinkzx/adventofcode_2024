// maybe do BFS at each tile on the racetrack. and see that for any depths that is within 20 steps, whether this new tile is higher than where we started from.
// add this start,end position into a set. and then count how many there are?

// when doing BFS, anything up till 20 steps that is a ".", we check the tile number
// also maybe in our BFS queue, we pass in the number of stesps it takes to get to this point, take the min?
